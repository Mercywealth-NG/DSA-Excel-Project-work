Considering that Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platform in the world, I am glad to have worked on this project to the best of my ability. I moved from being scared of the data (because it was really plenty and can be scary to first timers) to gradually playing around it all till it became clean. I do not care much about the rating this project work may get, I care more about the fact that i started it at all and finished it to the best of my ability. I am super grateful for the privilege to have attempted this project. Thank you to the DSA Organizers, the Incubator Hub and Papa Adeboye. 
Due to time, I could not build a wholistic Excel dashboard. If given another opportunity i would attempt this.
